# Text-to-Speech-Converter
This project is about a Text-to-Speech converter built using Python, with the  graphical user interface (GUI) created using tkinter and the text-to-speech functionality. This converter allows the user to input any text they wish to hear spoken out loud, and then converts the text into speech.
